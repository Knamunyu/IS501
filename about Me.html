                        <p>My journey to the U.S. was aided by many kind hearted people who became close family friends in the U.S. The journey began with the friendship I developed with an American friend Hunter Sebresos. Mr Sebresos had come to Kenya with his family to help his fellow American friend start a business. We met at a religious gathering in Mombasa, Kenya. As our friendship grew, we started visiting each other frequently. He suggested to me that studying in the U.S. would bring greater opportunities. He had become fond of listening to me on the radio in the morning as I hosted the breakfast show.
                        </p>
                        <p>Hunter was instrumental in helping me settle in the U.S. for school. Since then, he has become like a big brother to me. His family including his mother Dionna have become an integral part of my life. She is my American mother.
                        </p>
                        <p>I have made other important friends who have become family to me in America. First, is David Clark’s family. David is a former attorney and currently a commissioner in a Utah State commission. He has been in Kenya several times on official duty and developed admiration of the Kenyan people. His home has been a home for my friends like Emmnauel Amirikau, Andrew Sitati, Ozi Buhendwa and Mpilo Nkambule who is from Swaziland and I.
                        </p>
                        <p>Joel Campbell, a professor of Communications at Brigham Young University is one of the best professors I had in my undergrad. He taught me a few Communications classes including writing for Print, a class that helped me improve my writing skills. But more importantly, Mr. Campbell and his wife Jolene offered me their basement to live in while I attended my graduate school. That was a great relief since Ii could not work during the first two semesters of the MBA program. I’m grateful for the Campbell’s for their  kindness.
                        </p>
                        <p>The other person who became a great friend is Marlena Morningstar who I came to know later after graduating from my undergraduate program. She is a nurse from Seattle and has many friends in Kenya and she is one of the kindest people I have come across.
                        </p>
                        <p>In August 2021, I started my MBA program at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Utah, United States. I’m so passionate about customer-driven campaigns and initiatives, marketing communications and strategies, new public relations plans and business opportunities. My goal in business is to bring my media experience to marketing, especially product management, by leveraging proper research and understanding the needs of customers.</p>
                        <p>Currently, I’m the president of the Minority Leadership Association (MLA) that brings together Minority and international students in the MBA program. I’m also a member of MBA Marketing Association and a recipient of a Marriott school Business MBA scholarship.
